We only received one request for clarification from our customers, regarding model-controller
communication. We could have been more explicit in our descriptions of how all our components
communicate and where rule-keeping happened. Looking at our customer code, we can see
the importance of javadoc and fully describing our components for an outside viewer. We
found ourselves attached to our specific design and initially struggled to mold their code to
our structure, instead of adding to our design to find a middle ground. We leaned heavily on
the decorator pattern to pass messages with our model and publishers/subscribers and to
redirect their methods to our components instead directly re-implementing their behavior in our
classes.
Our providers were responsive to our emails when we did have to ask for descriptions, and
provided a diagram of how their coordinate system worked; we found they were helpful in answering
our questions quickly, which we appreciated.
